## Today

Today we woke up and drank coffee. It was most excellent and tasted great. Unfortunately, Brian left his notebook at home and is a little *frustrated*! Ultimately, though, he doesn't care. The day is __good__.

## Currently

We're in class at Epicodus. Still drinking coffee! Still without a notebook.

## Steps of the day:
* drove to Max lot
* got on crowded Blue Max
* off at Pioneer Square
* walked three blocks
* arrived
* got down to coding!
